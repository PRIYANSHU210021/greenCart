✅ Why create a copy?
In JavaScript (and especially in React), you shouldn’t directly modify the original array—because:

React may not detect changes if you mutate the original

It could lead to unexpected bugs or side effects

By using .slice(), you get a shallow copy of the array, which is safe to modify or filter.
